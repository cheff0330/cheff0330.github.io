<h1>journal entry 10/29/23</h1>
<p>In order to make the jumpscares, first I had to get my images and gifs by giving them a height, a width, and linking the image address to the jumpscare page. I also had to say how far away I wanted each image from different side of the screen. For example, if I wanted an image to be close to the left side, I would put write "0px" to put it right on the left side. Then, in order to have the images move, I had to add eventlisteners and give each image a function </p>


<h1>questions </h1>
<p>What exactly does console.log mean? Sometimes when I inspect, it doesnt always show my mistakes. Why is that? Can we go over what rgb and its meaning? I still dont fully understand how to do this. </p>


<h1>11/14/23</h1>
<p>a function is what appears in the console log

<h1>11/20/23</h1>
<p>I decided to make my gratitude card for my sister because I wanted to show her how much she meant to me her. In order to make it, I had to first, make a div for the heart and the "i love you" sign that first pops up when you click the link. Then, I had to download the pictures I wanted of me and my sister and drag them into the github file. Once I did that, I was able to add an event listener saying that whenever someone clicks the touchpad, an image pops up replacing the heart. Finally, I downloaded the song "celebrate" and dragged into my file, in order to put it on my card. I gave it an id of music and then under the part where it tells the images to pop up each time I click my touchpad, I wrote music.play( ) which told it to play the music on the click aswell.</p>

<h1>chat gpt</h1>
<p>
I asked chat gpt "what does appendChild mean" and it explained how it tells javascript to add HTML elements or content to a wed page. It takes data from the "parent" element add something we call a "child" element.

<h1>make smoothie</h1>
<p> In order to make this html page, I had to make a div for my blender image and each of my ingredients and gave them the class of toppings. Then I had to add an event listener saying that when you click on a topping, the image keeps popping up wherever else you click on the screen. I also gave everything the variable of "hi" which meant gave the elements specific identifiers that could be manipulated/accesible when coding.
